Get all of your textbooks with the “snap” of a picture, none of the hassle, all on your smartphone. We do the leg work by sending the shipping box overnight to you, and find a buyer for your old books, at a competitive cost compared to industry averages. TXTBookSwap aspires to be the premier textbook sharing community application available to college students in the United States and eventually the world within ten years.</p> <h3>Digital Products/Services</h3> <p>Our online application which utilizes cutting edge technology like OCR, which allows you to take a picture of your course syllabus in order to buy/sell/trade your books directly off of the app after comparing prices online. TXTBookSwap is a streamlined version of an online bookstore, appealing to the millennial generation and generations to come that are looking for easier and simpler solutions to everyday problems like finding the best price on a required textbook.</p> <h3>Market Opportunity</h3> <p>There is vast market opportunity in the online textbook market. This window is chiefly a reslut of recent government intervention that requires the unbundling of hardcopy textbooks, online subscriptions, and digital textbooks. We will transmit our value to this market and have four percent of all college-bound eighteen to twenty four year old Americans on our app within three years of launching, which is around 440,000 students. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the price of textbooks has risen more than 800% over the past 30 years, no good.</p> <h3>Strategy and Implementation</h3> <p>Through the use of targeted marketing to college students at universities with higher than average textbook costs, both online through social media, and through campus direct mailings we will capture a substantial market share within three years of doing business.</p> <h3>Financial Plan</h3> <p>Charging only seven dollars per transaction hosted on the application, we can earn a projected positive net income of $227,902 by year two of operations. In year three, N.I. will be $842,401.</p> <h3>Expected Outcomes</h3> <p>As a result of our efforts, and consistent customer product satisfaction rates, we expect that TXTBookSwap will be a profitable venture after one year of operation and a major competitor in the long run against our top six competitors that currently hold the market. We will expand to every college campus in America within three years, and all major global campuses within ten.</p>
